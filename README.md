### 🚀 The Full-Stack Edge
I don't just write code; I architect end-to-end solutions. My approach bridges the gap between sophisticated mobile interfaces and scalable backend infrastructures.

- **Mobile Mastery:** Deep expertise in Flutter & Native iOS (Swift). I thrive in the "Gray Area" of hybrid development—building complex Method Channels, ARKit integrations, and high-performance visualizations.
- **Architectural Mindset:** Not bound to a single stack. From AWS-powered backends to Dockerized microservices, I ensure every layer of the product is robust.
- **AI-Augmented Velocity:** I leverage advanced AI workflows to accelerate debugging and architectural design, delivering 2x productivity without compromising code quality.
